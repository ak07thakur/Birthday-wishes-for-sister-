UPLOAD & HOST ON GITHUB PAGES
1. Create a GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload the contents of this folder (index.html and the assets/ folder).
3. In the repo Settings -> Pages, set "Branch: main" and "Folder: / (root)". Save.
4. Wait a minute; your site will be live at:
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
5. Replace assets or edit text as needed. This project uses an external hosted soft guitar audio file.
